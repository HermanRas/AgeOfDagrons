# AGENT_GAME_CODER.md

Bootstrap for the **game-code agent** on AOD_Mobile. Paste this at the start of a
session so the next one does not have to rediscover any of it.

Its counterpart is [AGENT_ASSET.md](AGENT_ASSET.md) — the art-pipeline agent's
equivalent. **Read both before starting.** The two agents share one working tree
and one repo, and each owns a side of a fence described below.

---

## 1. Who I am and what I own

I am the game-code agent. **I own `game/`** — the Godot project: `src/`, `data/`,
`scenes/`, `tests/`, `dev_preview/`.

**I do NOT own, and must not edit:**

| Not mine | Why |
|---|---|
| `tools/` | isobake recipes + bake/stage scripts — the art agent's |
| `art_work/out/` | baked atlases; build output |
| the isobake source | its own repo, `Downloads\AOD_game\blender_3d_to_2d_isobake` |
| `ASSET_MISSING.md` | the art agent's tracker |

`game/assets/atlases/` is *staged* art. It is gitignored and normally written by
the art agent's `tools/stage_atlases.py`. I read it freely; I only ever write to
it when the project owner explicitly asks me to pull art across (has happened
once — see §6).

**How the two agents talk:** [asset_request.md](asset_request.md). I append a
request using the format at the bottom of that file; the art agent answers
inline under the same heading. It works well — treat it as a conversation, and
answer their questions there rather than only in chat.

## 2. Authoritative documents, in priority order

1. **[Age & Unit Planning.md](<Age & Unit Planning.md>)** — THE ROSTER. Every
   line is an entity *template path*, not a hint about what kind of unit is
   wanted; the actor to bake is one hop inside the file's `<VisualActor><Actor>`.
2. **[PLAN.md](PLAN.md)** — architecture and phase order. §1 locked decisions,
   §2.7/§2.7.1 the age+faction skin model, §9 the data schema.
3. **[IDEA.md](IDEA.md)** — what we're building. **[UI_Design.md](UI_Design.md)**
   — how it looks, plus the `.jpg` mockups beside it.
4. `game/data/*.json` `_note` blocks — these are long, and they are the real
   design record for the data. **Read them in full before editing that file.**
   Several encode measurements and decisions that are expensive to re-derive.

⚠️ **PLAN.md is mojibake** — double-encoded UTF-8, so most table rows cannot be
matched by an exact-string edit. Splice by line prefix if you must change it.

## 3. Commands

Godot is **pinned at 4.7.1** and is not on PATH:

```
C:\Users\herman.ras\Downloads\Godot_v4.7.1\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe
```

```powershell
# The test suite — the one check that matters. Run before declaring anything done.
& $godot --headless --path game res://tests/run_tests.tscn --quit

# Refresh the global class cache. REQUIRED after adding any new `class_name`,
# or the suite fails with "Identifier not declared in the current scope".
& $godot --headless --path game --import

# Run the real match, driven and screenshotted (see §5)
& $godot --path game res://dev_preview/preview_match.tscn
& $godot --path game res://dev_preview/preview_match.tscn -- --interactive   # play it
```

Screenshots land in `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\AgeOfDragons\`.

There is **no CI**. Every check is a local command someone runs by hand.

## 4. Architecture invariants — do not break these

- **The sim carries no view types and no floats.** `src/sim/` may not extend
  Node, read input, load assets, or name a `view/` class.
  `tests/sim/test_sim_boundary.gd` greps for this and will fail you.
- **Input never mutates state.** A tap becomes a `Command`, goes to the server
  (even in a solo match, which is hosted on loopback), is `validate()`d, and
  applies on a tick boundary.
- **The server is the only trust boundary.** If the HUD hides an option, the
  command must also refuse it. Age gating is enforced in *both* places for
  exactly this reason.
- **`colours.json` order is load-bearing.** Saves and replays index into it.
  Never reorder.
- **`atlas_for()` is total** — it never returns null. An unknown id resolves to
  a loud magenta placeholder. That is what lets gameplay ship before art.
- **The asset seam is the only place filenames live** (`data/visuals.json` +
  `game_data.gd`). No filename in gameplay code.
- **Prefer extending `data/*.json` over hardcoding.**

### The skin key (PLAN.md §2.7.1)

`GameDataRegistry.atlas_for(visual_id, age, colour)` composes two independent
axes:

- **age** picks the base bake from the entry's `ages` map. That map is **dense by
  contract** — all four ages named explicitly, two ages that look alike simply
  point at the same file. `_validate_skins()` fails the suite on a gap.
- **colour** is a suffix transform on whatever age chose, gated by a
  `"colours": true` flag. isobake names tinted bakes `vis.<id>.<colour>`, so
  eight players are one boolean rather than eight declared paths.

Buildings carry the age; **units do not** — one actor in all four ages. Units
carry `age_required`, which is a *gate*, not a skin.

---

## 5. Working style that has actually paid off

- **Run the game, don't just test it.** `dev_preview/preview_match.tscn` boots
  the real match scene and drives it — selects a villager, opens the build menu,
  pages it, advances the age, trains units, screenshots each step. It has caught
  several things no headless test could: a HUD badge landing on top of the
  resource counters, a panel whose background cropped wrong, text drawn over the
  counters. **Look at the screenshot.** Crop and 2× zoom it if the detail is
  small.
- **A screenshot taken in the same frame as an action shows the state before
  it.** Commands round-trip through a snapshot. Shoot on a later step.
- **Beware fixtures that agree with the bug.** This has bitten twice, both times
  the production queue: a test fixture described the shape the code *actually
  produced* rather than the shape it *should*, so the test stayed green while the
  game was visibly wrong. When a bug reaches the screen, check whether a fixture
  was covering for it.
- The project owner reviews by screenshot and gives precise UI feedback. Expect
  it and act on it directly — it is usually right and usually cheap.

## 6. Gotchas that cost real time

| Gotcha | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Godot deletes comments in `project.godot` and `.tscn` on save** — triggered by `--import` *and* by simply running the game | Never put durable knowledge there. The orientation explanation now lives in `src/view/device_check.gd`. Check `git diff game/project.godot` after any editor/game run. |
| **Godot silently rewrites `scenes/ui_builder/*.tscn` layout properties** when the project is open | Check `git status` before committing; those are authored mockups and should not drift. |
| **`Array[StringName].sort()` orders by StringName IDENTITY, not string content** — and identity order is not stable between runs | Never take `unit_ids()`/`building_ids()` order into UI. Re-sort explicitly (the build menu sorts by age, then name). |
| **`&"unit.villager" == "unit.villager"` is FALSE** | JSON has no StringName, so everything off the wire is a String. Convert at the boundary (`GameView._names()`). |
| **PS 5.1 splits a here-string into git pathspecs** | Write the commit message to a file, `git commit -F <file>`. Never pipe a here-string. |
| **`Set-Content -Encoding utf8` adds a BOM** and has corrupted `project.godot` | Use .NET `WriteAllText`/`WriteAllLines` with `UTF8Encoding($false)`. |
| **A new `class_name` is invisible until `--import`** | Run it, then the suite. |
| **Staged atlases lag `art_work/out` silently** | A stale-but-valid atlas renders fine and is simply the wrong actor. Read `attribution.actor` out of the staged `.atlas.json` to tell — filenames and mtimes will not show it. |
| **Two agents, one working tree** | Commits interleave. Check `git log` and what you actually staged; the art agent may have already committed your shared file (`asset_request.md`). |

## 7. Where things stand

**Data is complete for the v1 roster:** 19 buildings with dense four-age skin
maps, 21 units, all footprints measured (each baked atlas resolved back through
`attribution.actor` to its 0 A.D. template, parent chain walked to
`<Obstruction><Static>`, max taken per axis across the four ages).

**293 atlases staged.** 45 test files, ~517 tests, all passing.

**Working end to end:** age skins (Briton → Gaulish → Iberian/Achaemenid →
Roman), per-player colour selection from eight baked atlases, age-gated train and
build menus, a paged build grid, captioned portraits, production queue, and a
debug age-advance.

### Known gaps — do not work around these silently

- **Only `red` and `yellow` colour bakes are trustworthy.** 60 others are
  *stale, not absent* — present, parsing, drawing, and wrong, because three
  pipeline defects were fixed mid-roster. `GameDataRegistry.stale_colour_atlases()`
  enumerates them; `missing_colour_atlases()` finds absent ones. Develop against
  players 2 and 3.
- **Walls have no building defs.** All 24 pieces are baked and declared in
  `visuals.json` so the art is wired and testable, but a wall needs
  drag-placement, segment-length choice, 8 orientations and gate pass-through.
  As ordinary buildings they would put twelve fixed-orientation blocks in the
  build menu, which is worse than not offering them.
- **`pop_used`/`pop_cap` are never computed.** Nothing enforces population.
- **`elite_swordsman` renders two overlapping bodies during death.** Known,
  diagnosed, importer-level. Do not try to fix it in the game layer.
- **Ships, dragon, ballista, onager and trebuchet are static** — no walk clip.
  Trebuchet, ballista, onager and dragon carry `speed: 0` deliberately, so a
  motionless sprite never slides across the map.
- **Age advancement is debug-only** (`DebugSetAgeCommand`, the gold badge in the
  HUD header). PLAN.md 9.2 replaces it with a researched action that costs
  resources and time.
- **HUD portraits, minimap and control groups** are wired for colour; nothing
  else tints, because colour is in the pixels — **there is no tint shader and
  must not be one.**

## 8. For the art agent

See **[AGENT_ASSET.md](AGENT_ASSET.md)** for their side: recipes, bake batches,
staging, the isobake pipeline, and what they consider stable versus in flux.
That file is theirs to write and maintain — I do not edit it, the same way they
do not edit this one.

If the two documents ever disagree about the fence between us, the disagreement
itself is the thing to fix — raise it in `asset_request.md` rather than quietly
picking a side.
